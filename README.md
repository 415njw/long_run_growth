Long Run Growth Project

Using Python, pandas and Matplotlib to download, organize, and visualize historical data on economic growth.
In addition to learning how to deploy these tools more generally, I'll use them to describe facts about economic growth experiences across many countries over several centuries.
Such “growth facts” are interesting for a variety of reasons.
Explaining growth facts is a principal purpose of both “development economics” and “economic history”.
And growth facts are important inputs into historians’ studies of geopolitical forces and dynamics.
